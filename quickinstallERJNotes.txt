deploying the project (for reference: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
  fork from: https://github.com/yalelibrary/yul_hydra_head2
  git clone https://github.com/<youraccount>/yul_hydra_head2.git
  cd yul_hydra_head2
  git clone git://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-jetty.git ../jetty
  cp -R ../jetty jetty
  bundle install

starting the jetty server (which deploys fedora and solr)  
  rake jetty:start

accessing the jetty server (replace libserver3 with your server)  
  http://libserver3.yale.edu:8983
    (should display 404 ERROR screen with links to contexts) 
    contexts most likely to use:
      http://libserver3.yale.edu:8983/fedora
	  http://libserver3.yale.edu:8983/solr/#/
	
ingest rake tasks
  rake yulhy:hydra_publish_refresh
    for refreshing the production database before a test ingest
    caution: we don't have a test db, this refreshes pamoja production!
  rake yulhy:delete_fedora
    for deleting fedora and solr in local instance of jetty
    usage example:
	  yulhy:delete_fedora[changeme,1,200]
	    deletes all PIDs between changeme 1 and 200
  rake yulhy:ingest
    looks for all eligible records in hydra_publish table and ingests them
	recommended usage example:
	  rake yulhy:ingest > ingest.txt
